          Community Patrol NZ has a vision of a safer New Zealand. Our
          contribution to that is through actively patrolling communities to
          prevent crime and reduce harm. In partnership with the Police, our
          more than 4,000 patrollers across Aotearoa New Zealand help keep kiwis
          and visitors safe.

          Community Patrols are organised and operated by their local
          communities and raise their annual operating expenses through local
          grants, sponsorship and donations.

          Funding received will help us with expenses running our vehicle,
          getting a dashcam and update our first aid kits.
